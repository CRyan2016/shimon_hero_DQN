## Overview

Meet Shimon, a 4-armed Marimba-playing improvising robot at the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology!

The aim of this project is to develop a learned representation of Shimon's physical constraints for use in real-time musical improvisation. We implement an extension of DeepMind's Atari-playing Deep Q Network that approximates a simple Left-Right Motor Cortex of the an animal brain. After training, the network learns bi-manual coordination in a virtual environment and out-performs a human at the same task.
